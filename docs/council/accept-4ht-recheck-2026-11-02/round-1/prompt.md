# Council

You are the sole member (astra) of a re-check round grading the document below, bennett-4ht re-check dossier of four accepted contract proposals (z4c, adg, checker-diagnostics, 5u3). The document is a dossier concatenating four contract proposals (z4c, adg, checker-diagnostics: ISA 0.9; 5u3: dialect) that a two-model council (sol, astra) ACCEPTED in round 1 on 2026-11-02 with empty blocking lists, before the bennett-4ht standing check was added to the rubric. Scope of this round (advisor ruling R6(b), binding): re-check each of the four against the bennett-4ht rubric check ONLY, i.e. the rubric's "Standing check: the mixed fat object stays reachable" under C7. Their contract content was accepted in round 1 and is not under review: do not re-grade it and do not raise blocking items on it. Score criteria C1-C8 as you find them, but only a failure of the bennett-4ht check may be blocking.

You run read-only in `bennett-isa-spec`. The ISA text the three ISA proposals amend is `spec/Bennett-ISA-Spec-0.9.md`; the dialect text 5u3 amends is under `../bennett-dialect-spec/spec/`. Read every clause a proposal touches that decides object format, certificate layout, launch API, budgets, handle representation, effect tape or host memory by reference. Other files: `../bennett/docs/Bennett-NorthStar.md` (north star, §2, §3.3, §4.4; attached below), `../bennett/docs/council/contract-<id>-2026-11-02/round-1/` (each proposal's round-1 prompt, member outputs and consensus), `.beads/issues.jsonl` and `../bennett/.beads/issues.jsonl` (bead bennett-4ht).

For EACH of the four proposals decide: PASS (it does not touch those topics, or it states how a mixed fat object uses it, and nothing in it assumes the device object is the whole binary: entry points, argv/envp, libc closure, native comparison, certificate inventory) or FAIL. A proposal that does not touch any of those topics passes; do not invent obligations for it. For every FAIL give one blocking item with `id` prefixed by the proposal id (e.g. `z4c-4HT-1`), scope `contract` unless the change is core, and a `fix` that writes out the exact statement the proposal must add and the section it goes in. Return `accept` only if all four pass. The `summary` must begin with one line per proposal of the form `<id>: PASS` or `<id>: FAIL (<blocking id>)`. In `path_to_accept` list the statements to add, per failing proposal.

Be constructive, always. The editor must be able to act on your output without asking you anything.

Answer only with JSON matching the schema.

Convergence rules for this round:
1. Blocking means a failure of the bennett-4ht standing check only (it is S0 by the rubric). Everything else, including anything you would have raised against the contract content, goes in `suggestions`.
2. The check asks only that the fat object stays reachable. It does not ask for the launch ABI or a host shim to be implemented now.
3. This is a re-check round with no previous blocking items: leave `previous_status` and `regressions` empty.
4. Give `verdict_core` for the core scope alone and `verdict` for the whole dossier.


Blocking items: `steps` are optional; use them (3 to 6 objects {"n": "<1>1", "claim": "...", "by": "..."}) for implementation findings with a reproducible witness, else give a free-text `problem`; leave the other empty.
Steps: <1>1 what the spec requires (`by`: `clause:<ID>` or `ASSUMED: <why the spec is silent>`); <1>2 what the implementation does (`witness:<path or command>`); <1>3 an input where they differ; last step cites earlier ones (`step:<1>1`).
`OPEN: <what is missing>` marks an unjustified step; several `by` parts are separated by `; `.
If the spec is silent (step 1 or `problem` begins `ASSUMED:`) set `kind` to `spec-gap` (otherwise `implementation`); a spec gap goes to the spec owner,
is not an editor blocker and does not count against `accept`.


# Rubric

# ISA-specification rubric — the council's scale

The rubric the council (`docs/council/README.md`) uses to grade
`Bennett-ISA-Spec.md`, the founding draft of the Bennett virtual ISA
specification (the `bennett-isa-spec` contract of `Bennett-NorthStar.md`
§4.4 and §6.1). Eight criteria, each scored 1–5 on an absolute scale, plus
blocking issues, a path to accept, and verdicts. Scores are advisory; the
maintainer decides.

## What is being graded, and the goal

A **specification**, at the level of a first normative draft: the
document a VM author, a circuit-specialiser author, a plugin author, a
scheduler author and a hardware vendor would each implement against,
independently, and be conformance-tested on. The maintainer's stated
goal is **an accepted spec that is likely correct**; implementation is
expected to expose frictions afterwards, and that is acceptable. So the
question is not "is every detail enumerated" but "would two independent
implementers build the same machine, and is that machine sound".

## Blocking, S0 and S1, scope

A **blocking** issue is **S0**: uncorrected, two conformant
implementations built from the text would compute different results;
or the semantics is unsound (irreversible where reversibility is
claimed, unphysical, phase-unsafe, dependent on inspecting superposed
data); or the text contradicts itself; or a normative decision is
missing where one is needed to build at all; **or the document narrows
north-star scope**: it rejects, refuses, faults, declares inert or
omits a capability that `Bennett-NorthStar.md` promises (its thesis,
§3–§5 and every rung of the §8 demo ladder), whatever reason it gives.
A narrowing is blocking even when it is disclosed, labelled deferred,
or given a default; the fix is the mechanism, or, where a contract the
document depends on truly lacks something, an explicit blocker naming
the exact change that contract needs.

**S1** issues are ones where an implementer would have to choose, but
any choice yields a conformant machine, or where the normative
obligation is stated and only its enumeration is incomplete (field-
level completeness of C headers, JSON schemas, numerical procedures,
encodings). S1 items are **suggestions**, not blockers, **unless the
document fails to state a default for them**; the document carries a
section of decisions deferred to implementation, each with a default,
and an S1 item with a stated default is closed **only if the default
keeps the capability**. A deferral may postpone mechanics (an encoding,
a table layout, an optimisation); a default of "reject", "refuse",
"none", "fault" or "no effect" for something the north star promises
is a narrowing, hence S0, not a closed S1.

Every blocking issue is tagged with a **scope**: `core` (machine model,
instruction set, regions, uncomputation validity, memory and effects,
formal model, the example objects) or `contract` (targets, objects and
identity, launch, scheduling, certificate, coverage, grammar).
**Acceptance is staged**: core consensus (every member's `verdict_core`
= accept with no core blocking issue) is the first milestone; the
contracts follow. Members give both verdicts.

## The standard

The PTX ISA document, the JVM specification, the RISC-V unprivileged spec,
the LLVM language reference: a stranger implements from the text alone,
and two strangers get the same machine. Precision within full scope:
the scope is fixed by the north star and is not the document's to
trade; within it, a mechanism defined exactly scores above one defined
loosely, and a document never buys precision by cutting scope (that is
a narrowing, S0 above). Skepticism is required: check the quantum semantics
and the reversible-ABI claims against your own knowledge; when the
document ships example objects with hashes and stated results, they are
normative test vectors and have been executed before this round.

### Scale

- **5:** implementable by strangers with no questions; sound; complete for
  its declared scope; nothing superfluous.
- **4:** implementable with one gap an implementer names at once.
- **3:** a competent draft; the shape is right but several rules need an
  author's clarification before implementation.
- **2:** aspirational; semantics sketched, not pinned.
- **1:** inconsistent or unphysical at the core.

## Criteria

### C1 Machine model
Tiers, state, types, the step relation: unambiguous? Could two
implementers draw the same state diagram?

### C2 Instruction set
Every instruction with form, operands, well-formedness, semantics, cost
hook; closed and sufficient for what the dialect must lower; nothing
underdetermined.

### C3 Coherent semantics
The predicated step machine, the oracle interface F_B, the action
interface, nesting, exit synchronisation, the prefix-reversal invariant,
the fault register, the budget unit, in-place bijections, the
uncomputation-validity invariant, borrow frames: checkable rules, nothing
irreversible, phase-unsafe or dependent on inspecting superposed data.

### C4 Resources and targets
Resource vector, qubit classes, the target-description format, matching
and cost rules: complete enough that a vendor could write one and the
scheduler consume it, with defaults where the spec defers.

### C5 Contracts
Object format, identity, linking, reversible ABI, launch ABI, scheduling
interface, certificate schema, coverage: each **decided** to the level the
north star promises, so the repositories can be developed independently;
S1 enumeration gaps with stated defaults do not lower this score below 4.

### C6 Formal model and conformance
Abstract semantics an implementer can check against; theorems stated
with explicit hypotheses; a conformance suite derivable from the text.
**Formal correctness is pursued after practical revisions** (maintainer
decision, 2026-10-28): proof formats, mechanisation, rigorous numerical
or SDP witness schemas and checker algorithms are S1 in this phase. A
false or unsound statement is S0; a missing proof is not.

### C7 Consistency with the north star and prior art
No contradiction with `Bennett-NorthStar.md`; established forms used
where they exist.

### C8 Implementability and clarity
Could a VM author and a specialiser author each start tomorrow? Are the
deferred items genuinely non-semantic, each with a default?

### Standing check: the mixed fat object stays reachable (maintainer 2026-11-02, bennett-4ht)
Apply to every ISA and dialect round, under C7. Does this contract change keep the mixed fat object reachable (native host binary + only marked modules as VM ISA objects, north star §2, §3.3, §4.4; bennett-4ht)? A change that decides object format, certificate layout, launch API, budgets, handle representation, effect tape or host memory by reference must state how a mixed fat object would use it or name the exact change needed; nothing may assume the device object is the whole binary (entry points, argv/envp, libc closure, native comparison, certificate inventory). Silence on these topics is a revise. Report a failure of this check as a blocking item (scope `contract`, unless the change is core) whose `fix` names the statement the document must add; return `revise`, never `accept`, while it stands. The check asks only that the fat object stays reachable. It does not ask for the launch ABI or a host shim to be implemented now.

## What the council returns

Per criterion: a score 1–5, evidence pointing at the text, the single
change that would most raise it. Then `blocking` (id, section, scope,
severity S0, problem, and the concrete rule the spec should state),
`previous_status` (every previous-round blocker: resolved / partially /
unresolved / regressed, with a note), `regressions`, `suggestions`
(S1 and nits), `path_to_accept`, `verdict_core`, `verdict`, `summary`.
Consensus is reached when every member returns `accept` with an empty
blocking list; core consensus when every member returns `verdict_core`
= accept with no core-scoped blocker.

**Shape of a blocking item.** `steps` are optional (a free-text `problem` is also accepted; steps are preferred for
implementation findings with a reproducible witness). When given they are 3 to 6 numbered steps
`{"n": "<1>1", "claim": "...", "by": "..."}`. Step 1 is what the spec requires (`by`
starts with `clause:<ID>`, a clause or section id from the clause graph, or with
`ASSUMED: <why the spec is silent>`); then what the document or implementation does, with a `witness:<path or
command>` that reproduces it; then an input on which the two differ; the last step is the
conclusion, citing earlier steps with `step:<n>`. `OPEN: <what is missing>` marks a step you
cannot justify. If step 1 is `ASSUMED:` the item is a spec gap: set `"kind": "spec-gap"`; it is
reported to the spec owner and is neither an editor blocker nor counted against `accept`.
The `fix` field is unchanged.


# Background (not graded): `Bennett-NorthStar.md`

# Bennett — North Star (reboot vision, iteration 7 — council consensus)

**Date:** 2026-10-28. **Status:** vision settled at the level of "what it
truly looks like"; technical design NOT started. Iteration 6 after council
rounds 1–5 (`docs/council/northstar-2026-10-28/round-*/report.md`; the
editor's responses are in `round-*/response.md`). Round 5: one accept, two
revise at mean 4.42/5, every earlier blocker confirmed resolved, one new
one (residual LLVM nondeterminism after poison/undef removal: NaN bits,
`fmuladd`, addresses), folded in here as a complete determinism contract.
Round 6: **all three members accept, no blocking issues, mean 4.46**; the
council loop on this document is closed, and this iteration applies only
wording fixes from that round. Nothing here is
implemented, and no code is to be written on the strength of this
document alone (maintainer process rule: vision, then design, then
spikes, then code).

**Provenance.** Written up from maintainer/agent design discussions on
2026-10-28. The maintainer's position on the quantum VM (§4) was formed
over a year of discussion across the quantum-information community; the
document states that position and the reasons, and asks to be judged on
the reasons.

**Relation to earlier documents.** Supersedes `Bennett-Reboot-Blueprint.md`
§3.1–§3.4 (its standalone "BIR" is dropped: the IR is LLVM IR with a
dialect inside it). The blueprint's §5 keep/kill list, §6 ladder and §7
risks carry over where they do not conflict. `Bennett-V2-PRD.md` remains
parked. `Bennett-VISION-PRD.md`'s Enzyme analogy turns out to be literal.

**Ground truth this was checked against** (2026-10-28 read-only survey of
both repos, the Astra reviews, BENCHMARKS.md, and the checkout of the now-
sunset Sturm.jl at `~/old/Projects/Sturm.jl`): worklog chunk 121, session
2026-10-28. The
current Bennett.jl / BennettVM.jl are deprecated as designs; their research
assets (arithmetic generators, soft-float with its test conventions, gate
algebra, scaling-relation regressions, the 6502 native-oracle harness) are
the only things carried forward.

## 0. Thesis

**Every program is already a quantum program.** The user never writes a
circuit, never declares a subset, never learns a new language. They write
C, Rust, Julia, anything LLVM eats, and the toolchain decides at every
instruction whether it runs classically, reversibly, or coherently. The
only thing a quantum programmer adds to a classical codebase is a handful
of marker calls: allocate qubits, rotate by theta, measure, and a way to
condition a region on a qubit. Everything else is inferred.

Tagline: **controlled-anything.** If it compiles with clang, you can put it
under a qubit. "Unmodified" means **no source edits**; build-configuration
flags and runtime shims are allowed and are recorded in the certificate.

Stated precisely, because precision is what makes the slogan true rather
than a slogan: *every execution of any LLVM program that is defined under
the reference semantics of §3.2, effect-bounded, and within a classical
resource budget can be run coherently under a qubit; executions that the
reference machine can see are outside that domain produce a named fault
outcome that is part of the result (§4.2), never a silent wrong answer
and never a crash of the region.* Source-level undefined behaviour that
the optimiser has already erased is not detectable by anyone after the
fact; it is covered by an explicit definedness assumption recorded in the
certificate, not by a fault guarantee (§3.2).

**The project is predicated on the hardware getting good enough:**
scalable logical quantum computation with plentiful logical qubits and
**logical gate times on the order of nanoseconds**. Every cost in this
document is counted in that regime; a kernel boot of billions of steps is
a design target only because of it. Efficiency is pursued hard;
universality is never traded for it.

## 1. Decisions (settled 2026-10-28, refined after council rounds 1–2)

1. **Bennett is the LLVM of quantum.** Language designers introduce quantum
   constructs *as they please*, the way LLVM lets anyone design a classical
   language. We provide the target and the optimiser, never the language.
2. **The IR is LLVM IR. We never fork LLVM.** Forking is the disaster
   scenario. Decades of classical optimisation are kept by sitting inside
   the ecosystem through mechanisms an out-of-tree plugin can actually rely
   on (§3). Where an upstream change would help, it is proposed upstream
   as a patch, never carried as a fork.
3. **Delivery is a pass plugin, a driver, and a runtime.** The plugin runs
   at **link time over whole-program bitcode** (§3.3): optimise, reverse,
   optimise. Any front end that can emit bitcode is supported; per-front-
   end integration is a driver concern, named per front end with its
   costs, never a language change.
4. **Three execution tiers, one program.** Classical (host, native code,
   never ours), reversible (device, deterministic forwards and backwards,
   effects on a tape), coherent (device, closed and effect-free, every
   control decision predicated, every region total with a fault output,
   §4.2). The quantum VM is the device, in the sense a GPU is a device.
5. **One virtual ISA, one target description per hardware.** The PTX move.
   The ISA is a versioned public specification with a conformance suite;
   the formal model is of the spec, not of any implementation.
6. **The VM is a scheduler over an extensible resource vector**, and its
   run-time policy depends only on classical data. Compile-time and run-
   time scheduling are the same optimiser, implemented once
   (`bennett-sched`) behind an interface the ISA spec owns (§4.4).
7. **Correctness is defined by a theorem, two oracles, and a fault
   outcome, never by a reversibility check** (§5.1). Certificates say
   which parts are proof and which are evidence.
8. **QIR, OpenQASM 3, Quil, and MLIR quantum dialects are edge formats**,
   read and written at the boundary. Never the semantics (§7).
9. **Languages: the right tool for the job, taste excluded** (§6).
10. **Many small repositories, published contracts, no monolith** (§6.1).

permanently differentially tested against each other and against native
execution of the same bitcode.

## 3. The dialect: what an out-of-tree plugin can rely on

This section lists only mechanisms that exist for a plugin today, states
what each does and does not guarantee, and names the legality spike that
gates freezing the spec.

### 3.1 Mechanisms

| Need | Mechanism (out-of-tree, stock LLVM) | What it does NOT give, and what covers the gap |
|---|---|---|
| Quantum operations: allocate (clean / dirty / class), release, gate, rotate(θ), measure, quantum-addressed load and store | **Declared external marker functions** `__bennett_*` with fixed signatures, exactly as Enzyme's `__enzyme_autodiff`. Not `llvm.*` intrinsics (a plugin cannot register them). The plugin recognises them by name and signature at link time. **Positive legality requirement:** a marker is declared as an external function that may read and write memory and may not return (no `readnone`, `readonly`, `speculatable`, `willreturn`, `nounwind`-only combinations that would license elimination, commoning or speculation). Stock passes then preserve the *dynamic sequence* of marker calls on every executed path. | Containing functions may be inlined, cloned, unrolled or versioned, so the *static* count of marker call sites is not preserved; the external declaration itself is never inlined. *Explicit quantum registers* are accessed only through markers, never through LLVM `load`/`store`, so no alias-analysis or forwarding pass can touch them. The ordinary loads and stores of lifted classical code (all of SQLite's) are not quantum-register accesses: they are lifted coherently according to the incoming memory model, as classical memory whose contents happen to be superposed. This legality is a property of ordinary effectful external calls, not of any attribute we invent; the legality corpus (§3.2) tests it. |
| Qubit handles | **Portable handles**: an ordinary `ptr` in address space 0 (or an integer handle) returned by `__bennett_qalloc`, which every front end can emit from unmodified source: clang, rustc, Julia. Never dereferenced by host code. The plugin normalises recognised handles into its internal representation after outlining, respecting the incoming target's pointer size. **Reference semantics at the dialect level.** | LLVM cannot enforce linearity; SSA uses are free to duplicate. Linearity is a fail-loud verifier obligation after outlining, plus the ISA's value semantics below. Collections of handles are supported through a **handle table**: an aggregate or array of handles indexed by a classical value (a compile-time constant or a classical-tier value) is lowered to table lookups; a handle that flows through memory at a superposed address, or through an `inttoptr`/`ptrtoint` round trip, is **rejected fail-loud** in v1 of the dialect; any handle use that survives into host native code is rejected likewise. Any code that touches handles or measurement results runs in the device's classical-control tier, never as host native code. This is the point on which QIR is faulted in §7, and the answer is to be explicit about it. |
| Qubit values in the ISA | **Linear value semantics in the virtual ISA** (wire form, as in Quake's wire dialect and QSSA): each use consumes, each definition produces. The plugin converts handles to wires after outlining and verifies the conversion. | Both forms exist, at named pipeline stages, for the same reason CUDA-Q keeps both. |
| Coherent memory and in-place update | **Copy-on-read, XOR-on-write, total-bijection-for-in-place** (§4.2): `__bennett_qload` is a CNOT copy of the register onto fresh wires (source preserved, copy is retained workspace until uncomputed under the validity invariant); `__bennett_qstore` XORs into its target, so a store into a known-clean register is a copy and a store into a register not known to be clean is a **compile-time error** (this source-level restriction is distinct from the oracle ABI, whose targets may hold any value); an in-place update x ← g(x) is written `__bennett_inplace(@g, @ginv, …)` and is admitted **only when g and ginv are mutually inverse total bijections on a declared finite encoding**, with budgets sufficient for forward evaluation and inverse cleanup, and is lowered compute-out-of-place, swap, uncompute-with-g⁻¹; library bijections (add a constant, xor, rotate, modular add, modular multiply with its coprimality condition and its treatment of unused encodings stated) carry their inverses and their g∘ginv = id certificates in `bennett-arith`. | A fallible or budget-limited computation cannot be in-place: it uses the out-of-place oracle interface (§4.2). A declared inverse is a correctness obligation: g∘ginv = id is checked by §5.1 part 1 at exhaustive small widths or carried as a library certificate, and a wrong inverse is caught because swap-then-uncompute leaves the scratch register non-clean. An in-place update with no inverse fails loud at compile time. Front ends may instead compose two compute regions and a swap themselves. This is what makes `when(q) do x += a end`, the founding use case of the Julia language (§6), work as written. |
| Taint: classical vs reversible vs coherent | **Analysis, not types**: a context-sensitive interprocedural analysis over data dependence, control dependence and memory effects, from marker results and region entries, over the whole-program call graph, with polyvariant specialisation when one function is used both classically and coherently. | No per-value attribute survives optimisation and none is needed. "Untainted" is defined relative to the resolved call graph, never per translation unit. |
| Control as structure: adjoint, controlled-by-qubit, compute-with-uncompute, reversible-tier entry | **Function granularity**: a region is outlined to a function (LLVM's `CodeExtractor`) and entered through a marker call `__bennett_ctrl(q, @f, budget, args…)`, `__bennett_adj(@f, …)`, `__bennett_compute(@f, …)`, or `__bennett_reversible(@f, budget, …)` for the reversible tier. The plugin generates controlled and adjoint bodies on demand from one source body. **Well-formedness:** a `ctrl`/`adj`/`compute` region is unitary: user measurement inside it is refused (or, when the front end asks for it, deferred by the deferred-measurement principle, which the certificate states); allocations inside are released clean or borrowed and restored; the compiler's own measurement-based uncomputation is the sole exception, and until its controlled form is fixed in the language's certificate kinds (§9.6) **unitary uncomputation is the fallback under control**. Exceptions and unwinding (`invoke`/`landingpad`, Rust panics, C++ `throw`) inside a region are step-machine control flow where the handler is in the region, and a fault code where it is not. | Front ends that want `when`-style syntax do the outlining themselves (Julia macro, clang attribute, Rust proc-macro) and emit the marker call; the dialect does not require it. Generating a body needs the callee's IR, which is why the plugin runs at link time (§3.3). |
| Bounds for coherent regions | **A region-level classical budget**: dynamic steps, heap bytes and recursion depth, passed as ordinary integer operands of the region-entry marker or supplied out of band by the host or driver (a project-wide default, a per-function table), and applied by the plugin after outlining. **No per-loop source annotation is ever required**, so unmodified SQLite, Linux and the Monte Carlo compile as they are. Per-loop bounds from scalar evolution, and optional per-loop markers, are *refinements* that let the specialiser tighten padding; they are not needed for correctness and no loop identity has to survive O3. | A region whose budget is exhausted on some basis input produces a fault outcome on that input (§4.2); it is never a compile error and never a truncated result. |
| Garbage and uncomputation | **Liveness analysis** on the outlined region plus the compute/uncompute marker; no lifetime intrinsics. | The scheduler decides when to pay to free a dead value; the dialect only has to make deadness computable. |
| Measurement and classical feedback | Marker call returning `i1`, flowing into ordinary `br` / `select` / `phi`, outside unitary regions. | Branching on a measurement result is classical control (§4.2). |
| Effects | Marker calls on the device side for the effects the device models (console, clock, entropy, block device); everything else is a host call. | Effect semantics per tier are in §4.2; an unvirtualisable effect inside a coherent region is a fault code on the executions that reach it, and a coverage-report line at compile time. |

### 3.2 Pipeline placement and the cost of staying in-tree

- **Correctness is invariant under LLVM's optimiser; cost is not.** Any
  semantics-preserving optimisation of the classical part is lowered as it
  stands, so differential testing (§5.1) is against the native binary
  built from the *same* optimised bitcode. Optimisations that erase or
  duplicate intermediate values change gate counts, so tainted regions get
  a curated region pipeline after outlining.
- **Definedness.** Source-level undefined behaviour cannot be "concretised"
  after an optimiser has exploited it (`clang -O3` turns `int y = 10/x;
  return 0;` into `return 0`, and nothing remains to fault on), so the
  document does not claim that. The contract, stated once and referenced
  by §0, §4.2, §5.1 and §8: **the reference semantics is the ISA formal-
  model interpreter run on the *materialised* optimised bitcode of the
  outlined region**, mapped by the dialect's reference semantics, before
  the curated region pipeline. **Materialised normalisation**, not
  `freeze`: LLVM's `freeze` yields an arbitrary fixed value that codegen
  lowers to whatever the register holds, so it cannot define one meaning
  shared by native code and the device. Instead the normaliser rewrites
  the region's optimised bitcode into a **poison-free, undef-free form**:
  poison-generating flags (`nsw`, `nuw`, `exact`, `inbounds` and kin) are
  stripped; partial operations are totalised with a stated result (a
  shift by ≥ width yields 0 through a `select`; division by zero and
  `sdiv`/`srem` of INT_MIN by −1 become faults, below); memory first
  touched inside the region (alloca and heap contents, and the padding
  of region-local objects) is zero-filled; any remaining `undef` operand
  is replaced by a stated constant; `llvm.objectsize`, `llvm.is.constant`
  and similar query intrinsics are lowered before both builds. Region
  inputs are **not** zero-initialised: they are the bytes the host
  supplies.

  Poison and undef are not the only choices LLVM leaves open, and the
  reference semantics **fixes every remaining one** so that the native
  comparison binary and the device implement the same function:

  - **Floating point is deterministic soft-float in both builds.** The
    normaliser rewrites every floating-point operation of lifted code
    into calls to the project's bit-exact soft-float library
    (`bennett-arith`, IEEE 754 binary64, round-to-nearest-even, a single
    canonical NaN with fixed sign and payload produced by *arithmetic*
    operations only, while `fneg`, `fabs`, `copysign`, loads, stores,
    `bitcast`, `select` and `phi` stay bit-exact as LangRef requires; no
    fused multiply-add unless the source wrote `fma` explicitly;
    `llvm.fmuladd` is rewritten to `fmul` + `fadd`; out-of-range
    `fptosi`/`fptoui` and the `minnum`/`maxnum` NaN cases have stated
    results); fast-math flags are stripped. Formats: binary64 and
    binary32 are covered; `half`, `bfloat`, `x86_fp80` and `fp128` are
    coverage-report lines until the library covers them, never silent
    widening. Hardware floating point never executes in either build, so
    NaN bits, fusion and intermediate rounding are identical by
    construction, including through `bitcast` and branches. The native
    comparison binary is the materialised region plus its entire
    materialised callee closure, linked against the same
    `bennett-runtimes` and `bennett-arith`, never against the host libc
    or libm.
  - **Addresses follow a deterministic layout model.** The heap is laid
    out by the same `bennett-runtimes` allocator shim linked into both
    builds at a fixed base with no ASLR; globals and functions are placed
    by a driver-controlled comparison link (non-PIE, fixed section
    addresses, constant merging and identical-code folding disabled) whose
    link map the device loader replicates. Region allocas are rewritten
    by the normaliser onto a shim-managed shadow stack in both builds
    where possible, which shrinks the remaining class: executions in
    which absolute *native stack* address bits still influence the
    payload or the fault are classified by the reference interpreter's
    **address-provenance** tracking as *layout-dependent*, excluded from
    native comparison, counted like the undefined class, validated
    against the reference interpreter instead, and recorded in the
    certificate.
  - **Faulting memory access is defined** by an object-bounds model in the
    reference semantics: a lifted load or store outside any live
    allocation is `FAULT_UB_MEMFAULT`. The artefact may therefore fault
    where native silently reads adjacent memory; "equals native, or is
    flagged" permits this, and the fault rate reports it.
  - **Atomics and volatile** in lifted code are sequentialised in program
    order (the single-thread assumption recorded in the certificate);
    concurrency is §9.11.

  After this the materialised bitcode has **one defined meaning**, which
  native codegen and the ISA interpreter both implement, and the native
  comparison binary is built from that materialised bitcode. Only
  immediate undefined behaviour that the reference machine encounters
  (traps, `unreachable`, faulting memory access, division by zero) remains,
  and it is a fault code (§4.2); compiled artefacts must never fault where
  the reference does not; native execution supplies success values, and
  fault *causes* come from the reference interpreter, since a native trap
  cannot tell division by zero from `unreachable`. Source UB that
  optimisation erased before this point is **not detectable** and is
  covered by an explicit definedness assumption recorded in the
  certificate, together with the LLVM version, the pipeline and the
  normaliser version, since the fault set and the materialised program
  depend on them. The normalisation rules are normative text in
  `bennett-dialect-spec`, enumerating every source they remove (poison
  literals, `nsw`/`nuw`/`exact`/`inbounds`, fast-math `nnan`/`ninf`,
  `!range`/`!nonnull`/`!noundef` metadata and the matching attributes,
  `llvm.assume`, undef vector lanes) and shipping a residual-poison
  validator implemented independently by the plugin and by
  `bennett-conformance`. The conformance
  harness classifies inputs with instrumented builds (UBSan, ASan, MSan)
  or a checked reference interpreter, as a separate build from the
  comparison binary; these are **supplementary classifiers**, not a
  complete decision procedure for source definedness, and inputs they
  flag are reported as *undefined* and excluded from comparison.
- **Regions are functions.** Every `when`, adjoint, compute and
  reversible-tier block outlines first. Enzyme lives with this.
- **Per-LLVM-major builds** of the plugin, as Enzyme is built. A mixed-
  language link (bitcode from different LLVM majors, different front-end
  IR idioms, one target datalayout) is supported only within a **tested
  compatibility envelope** published with each driver release: bitcode-
  reader versions, target layouts and ABIs, front-end pairs.
- **The legality spike** (§9.1) is a conformance corpus, not a design
  question: marker-bearing bitcode through every stock pass at O3, plus
  native code generation of fat objects, must preserve the dynamic
  sequence of marker calls on every path and must leave no handle use in
  host code. Freezing `bennett-dialect-spec` is gated on it passing, and
  on actual emission examples from clang, rustc and Julia.

### 3.3 Compilation model: link time, whole program, fat objects

Taint and controlled bodies depend on the calling context across the whole
program, and generating a controlled body needs the callee's IR. So:

- Front ends emit **bitcode** (clang `-flto`, rustc `--emit=llvm-bc` or
  `-Clinker-plugin-lto`, Julia through LLVM.jl). This is the one universal
  thing every LLVM front end does. No front end loads our plugin; pre-link
  per-TU optimisation sees markers only as unknown external calls, which
  is exactly the legality contract.
- **`bennett-driver`** merges the bitcode, runs LLVM's optimiser, loads the
  plugin at the LTO pipeline extension point (or runs it through `opt`),
  resolves taint over the whole call graph, and produces a **fat object**:
  native host code for the classical tier, ISA object(s) for the device
  tiers, and a certificate. clang's offload model (outlining, fat
  binaries, a launch runtime) is the **model**, not a reused mechanism: a
  middle-end pass cannot conjure clang's driver machinery, so we own ours.
- **Host-triple IR is what the device lowering accepts**: datalayout, ABI-
  lowered calls, target intrinsics and inline asm arrive as the host front
  end produced them. Target intrinsics and asm are classified *lowered /
  trapped / shimmed* in the coverage report. There is no `bennett` triple,
  because a plugin cannot add a clang target and we do not fork.
- **Stated coverage constraints:** a tainted call needs the callee's
  bitcode. Rust's distributed `std` normally carries embedded LLVM bitcode
  in its rlibs; the driver extracts it where present and compatible, and
  a rebuild (`-Zbuild-std`) is needed only where it is missing or from an
  incompatible LLVM major. The Julia runtime and precompiled native
  libraries need bitcode builds or shims (`bennett-runtimes`). Calls with
  no bitcode are coverage-report lines (*trapped*), never silent.
- **Per-front-end integration is named work**: clang needs only `-flto`
  and the driver; rustc goes through bitcode emission because its in-
  process plugin path is nightly-only; Julia goes through LLVM.jl and the
  same driver in-process. Bennett.jl is the Julia integration.
- A per-TU invocation remains available as a **fast path** for programs
  closed within one unit (the REPL case), with the same semantics.

## 4. The virtual ISA and the device

### 4.1 Why the VM is the revolution

The circuit model is to quantum programming what bare-metal machine code
was to classical programming before virtual machines, virtual memory and
portable ISAs: every program welded to one machine, every vendor with its
own toolchain, no dynamic allocation, no loops beyond what you unrolled by
hand, no portability, no way to ship one artefact to many machines. The
classical world escaped through abstraction layers *between* program and
hardware: virtual memory, the process, the JVM, LLVM, PTX.

Quantum programming has had abstract machines before: Knill's QRAM model
(1996), Quil's Quantum Abstract Machine, eQASM, and the circuit-plus-
classical-controller model every SDK ships. What none of them has is the
*rest* of the classical escape: virtual allocation with classes and
garbage as a resource, bounded coherent control over arbitrary programs
rather than hand-built circuits, separate compilation and linking, a
resource vector in the specification, and a program model that any LLVM
language targets without being rewritten. That combination is the layer
quantum programming lacks. The mistakes of the pre-VM era are listed so
the design never repeats them:

- **No program is written against a machine.** Programs target the virtual
  ISA; hardware implements the ISA through a target description.
- **Memory is virtual.** Qubits are allocated and released through the VM,
  never addressed physically. Clean, dirty and class are properties of an
  allocation request, not of a wire index.
- **Loops and recursion are instructions, not unrolling.** Budgets are
  values the VM enforces.
- **Resource accounting is part of the architecture**, in the ISA spec.
- **The spec is public and versioned.** Governance: PTX and the JVM each
  had a steward and a conformance regime; this ISA has a published spec, a
  conformance suite, and a steward who accepts target descriptions and
  revisions through a recorded process. A vendor implements it before an
  ecosystem exists for the reason vendors implemented PTX: the programs
  are written against it, not against them.

### 4.2 Execution semantics by tier

Two control disciplines, kept apart by name in the ISA:

- **Classical control** (host data, measurement results, run-time
  budgets): genuinely dynamic, an instruction pointer, data-dependent trip
  counts, real allocation. This is where run-time scheduling, history
  layers, checkpointing and pebbling policy live, and **every such
  decision may inspect only classical data**: an architectural invariant.
  Classical checkpointing never copies quantum state; a checkpoint of a
  coherent region is a point from which it is *recomputed*, which the
  scheduler may choose only where the region's own semantics permit.
- **Coherent control** (a decision that depends on a qubit): **predicated
  execution under a classical budget**, in both executors. The general
  construction, for an arbitrary and possibly irreducible post-O3 CFG, is
  a **predicated step machine**: a superposed block counter, stepped for
  the budget, every block executed under the predicate "the counter names
  me"; structured `pred { }` and `loop { }` blocks are optimisations of it
  that the specialiser applies where the CFG is structured. A branch on a
  qubit pays for both arms. An allocation whose size depends on a qubit is
  padded to its bound. The budget is classical and fixed before entry;
  run-time budgets come from the host or from measurement results, never
  from superposed data. **Nothing about the VM makes superposed trip
  counts observable or cheap; what it makes possible is choosing the
  budget at run time from classical data instead of at compile time.**

**Two region interfaces, kept apart by name.** Every coherent region is
one of:

- a **lifted classical oracle**: classical code that the plugin
  reversibilises. It computes one deterministic bounded result F_B(x),
  success or fault, with the interface and the XOR/involution properties
  below. Control is control of the XOR; adjoint is the same region.
- a **quantum action**: a region whose body contains non-permutation
  operations (rotations, Hadamards) or in-place bijections, acting as a
  unitary U on its **declared mutable wires**, with borrowed inputs
  preserved and workspace restored. Control means controlled-U, adjoint
  means U†. It need not be an involution and does not XOR; in-place
  bijections belong here, and because they are total bijections with
  bounded inverses (§3.1) a quantum action has no fault outcome of its
  own: any fallible computation it needs is a lifted oracle it calls,
  whose fault register it declares among its outputs. A quantum action
  whose body contains coherent internal control is, by definition, its
  bounded padded unitary under the declared bound, and that bound is
  part of the action's content identity and certificate entry (the same
  body under two bounds is two unitaries); the budget-fault guarantees
  of this section describe lifted oracles only.

Lifted oracles and quantum actions nest freely; the plugin classifies
each outlined region by its contents and the verifier checks the
declared interface. The step machine records, per step, which
predecessor it came from, which is what makes block-counter transitions
injective at control-flow joins; and at region exit it synchronises: all
branches pad to a common halt counter before control workspace is
restored (the Quantum Control Machine injectivity and synchronisation
conditions, §7).

**Totality of lifted oracles: F_B(x), success or fault.** The oracle's
interface is: inputs (preserved), a caller-supplied output target (any
value), a caller-supplied **fault register**, and workspace. The **budget
unit** is steps of the ISA formal-model interpreter on the materialised
outlined region (§3.2), so the fault set is a property of program plus
budget plus recorded LLVM version and pipeline, never of Bennett's own
lowering; compiled artefacts pad internally as needed and never fault
where the reference does not. On success, F_B(x) = (f(x), 0): the output
target is XORed with f(x) and the fault register is unchanged. On failure,
F_B(x) = (0, code): the output target is XORed with the **canonical zero
payload** (left unchanged) and the fault register is XORed with a distinct
code per cause (budget exhausted: steps, heap, recursion; immediate
undefined behaviour reached; unmodelled effect reached), the code chosen
by the reference semantics. Because both halves are XORs, the region is
an involution on its targets: repeated, controlled and adjoint invocation
compose by XOR accumulation, which is what Grover-style iteration needs.
Inputs are preserved, dirty registers are unchanged and clean workspace is
restored on *every* basis input, faulted or not, by the **prefix-reversal
invariant**: on a faulted branch the step machine continues to the budget
with the fault predicate off, and its recorded history is reversed exactly
as on a clean branch. Two implementations that return the same fault code
therefore return the same quantum state, not merely the same flag. The
fault register is part of the oracle's interface: algorithms test it,
resource estimates report it, and the acceptance tests of §8 require its
rate to be zero on their declared domains, because a nonzero fault code on
some basis inputs entangles the fault register with x and degrades the
interference an algorithm such as Grover relies on. Both executors
implement exactly this; the circuit specialiser is the VM's semantics
under a fixed budget, no more and no less.

**Coherent memory and the region interface.** Classical code acting on
quantum state that outlives a region has exactly these meanings (mirrored
in the dialect, §3.1): a read is a CNOT copy onto fresh workspace, the
source preserved; a write XORs into its target, so writing a known-clean
register is a copy and writing a register not known to be clean is a
compile-time error; region inputs are preserved and declared outputs are
XORed into caller-supplied targets, every other write being restored
workspace; an in-place update x ← g(x) requires a total bijection with a
bounded inverse (a declared `__bennett_inplace(@g, @ginv)` or a library
bijection, §3.1) and is lowered as compute-out-of-place, swap, uncompute-
with-g⁻¹, else it fails loud; a fallible computation is never in-place.
This is the rule that makes controlled modular arithmetic, and `when(q)
do x += a end`, compile from unmodified code.

**Uncomputation validity (the Silq `qfree`/`const` and Unqomp
condition).** Garbage is a cost choice inside a correctness envelope, not
free policy. Each garbage value records its dependency set and was
computed by a `qfree` (classical, permutation-tier) computation; both
halves of the Silq discipline apply. It may be uncomputed by reversal or
recomputation only while that set is unmodified since its computation,
and it **must** be cleaned before any non-permutation operation
(Hadamard, non-diagonal rotation, measurement) or in-place update acts on
a wire in its dependency set, and before the end of the enclosing unitary
region. Measurement-based uncomputation with phase fixup is the
sanctioned alternative where that window has closed, with the fixup
computed for the actual schedule: after an intervening U the correction
D becomes U D U†, and §5.1 part 2 verifies the fixup as scheduled, never
an assumed one.
Compile-time and run-time schedulers choose **only among schedules that
satisfy this invariant**; the handle→wire verifier rejects violations;
conformance exercises them with interference tests (§5.1 part 2). A
scheduler that deferred uncomputation past an interfering operation
would compute the wrong state while every ancilla still returned to zero,
which is exactly the class of bug the invariant exists to make
unrepresentable.

Effects by tier:

| Tier | Where | Effects | Undefined values |
|---|---|---|---|
| classical | host, native | real | real |
| reversible | device | recorded on the effect tape forwards, replayed backwards; the device models console, clock, entropy, block storage as reversible device models; entered through `__bennett_reversible` or a driver mode | refined by the materialised normalisation of §3.2; immediate UB is a fault, recorded |
| coherent | device | **closed and effect-free**: no external effect may occur inside a coherent region. Devices the program touches are virtualised as reversible state inside the device (an in-memory VFS, a console register, a device model) and become part of the oracle's state. Classical inputs are fixed before entry; outputs leave through measurement after exit. An effect the device cannot virtualise is a fault code on the executions that reach it. | refined by the materialised normalisation of §3.2; immediate UB is a fault code |

What the VM physically *is* at run time: a classical runtime that
schedules quantum operations. Coherent regions are lowered to predicated
blocks; the classical runtime decides when to run them, with what
resources, and how to uncompute their garbage, using only classical
information; at launch it lowers predicated ISA blocks to the target's
declared gate alphabet using `bennett-targets` capability declarations
(the specialiser does the same ahead of time). On a simulator target the
VM executes a **permutation segment** by **branch enumeration**: a
permutation applied to a state vector is a permutation of amplitudes, so
the segment is run once per basis configuration of the superposed inputs,
tracking the full configuration including garbage and virtualised device
state. Non-permutation gates between segments (rotations, Hadamards,
measurement-based fixups) are applied to amplitudes and may increase the
branch count. This is what makes small-instance end-to-end demos (§8)
checkable without a state vector the size of SQLite's memory.

### 4.3 Resources

- **The resource vector.** Qubit-time by qubit class is the base. Qubit
  classes are register classes: a target declares tiers with costs, and
  allocation chooses a class the way a register allocator does. Garbage
  carries an occupancy cost per qubit-second. Targets may add energy,
  routing, T, Clifford, measurement, or anything else; the ISA does not
  enumerate resources, the target description does. **Decision rule:** a
  target description supplies either a scalarisation (weights) or a
  lexicographic order over its resources; the scheduler optimises that
  objective and reports every component; conformance tests check the
  accounting of each declared resource against the target's own units.
- **Honest costs of superposition**: a coherent branch pays for both arms;
  a quantum-addressed memory access costs O(N) gates through QROM/QRAM
  circuits unless the target provides QRAM; coherent allocation is padded
  to its bound; dirty ancillae are cheaper to borrow and more expensive to
  use; a predicated step machine over an unstructured CFG costs the budget
  times the block count unless the specialiser recovers structure.
- **Allocation classes:** clean |0⟩ allocation, **dirty borrowing** (a
  first-class resource with no analogue in the current code), and release, with clean release and restored correlations as
  **semantic obligations** checked by simulation (§5.1), since they cannot
  be decided statically in general.

### 4.4 What the ISA spec owns

The ISA spec is one of the two contracts (§6.1). It owns, by name, every
format or interface two repositories exchange across the device boundary:

- the instruction set and its formal model (abstract semantics, the fault
  register, the round-trip theorem);
- the resource vector and the **target-description format**, including
  capability declarations (gate alphabet, QRAM, measurement) beyond costs;
- the **object format** for ISA programs and the **link format** for
  separate compilation, with a call/uncall convention and shared ancilla
  frames (the reversible ABI);
- the **host–device launch ABI**: how a host program starts, suspends,
  reverses, and reads back a device program, budgets and fault registers
  included;
- the **scheduling interface**: scheduling problem in (ISA program, target
  description, objective), schedule and certificate out, with the C ABI,
  objective semantics and versioning, so a competitor's scheduler is
  substitutable and a competitor's VM cannot invalidate compile-time
  schedules;
- the **certificate schema** that `bennett-circuits`, `bennett-arith`,
  `bennett-estimate` and `Bennett.jl` all consume, including the proof-
  versus-evidence labels of §5.1;
- the **coverage-report format** the driver emits;
- serialisation and versioning rules, and the conformance suite.

### 4.5 An illustrative sketch (non-normative)

Instruction classes, not encodings:

```
  region   budget={steps,heap,depth} outputs=… → outputs, fault   ; coherent region entry
  qalloc   class=<name> n=<classical>            → wires           ; clean

```

A target description names its qubit classes with costs, its native gate
alphabet, whether it provides QRAM, and its resource scalarisation:

```
  target: surface-code-d17-example
  classes: { logical: {qubit_second: 1.0}, dirty_pool: {qubit_second: 0.3} }
  gates:   { CX: {t: 0}, CCX: {t: 7, depth: 3}, RZ: {t: "synth(ε)"}, measure: {time: 1} }
  qram:    none
  objective: weighted { t: 1.0, qubit_second: 0.05 }
```

## 5. Scenes from the finished thing, and what "correct" means

**The REPL.** Define a Julia function. Do not compile it. Write
`when(q) do f(x) end` and it runs, in a simulator or on hardware, because
compilation is invisible, incremental, cached by world age, composable.
Quantum registers are REPL values with lexical lifetime. `@cost f(x)`
prints T-count, T-depth, logical qubits, and wall time on a named target,
the way `@time` prints allocations. Redefine `f` and everything downstream
recompiles. Hand a compiled function to another function as an ordinary
callee. The Lisp image, holding reversible objects with certificates.

**The toolchain.** `-flto` plus our driver beside clang. Point it at a
mature codebase: one fat object per link, a coverage report honest to the
instruction (lowered / trapped / shimmed), and a resource estimate. Partial
compilation is a region marker, and the toolchain is provably the identity
on everything outside the tainted call graph. The kernel compiles, boots on
the VM in the reversible tier with its devices modelled, writes a serial
console to the tape, and un-boots to the reset vector.

**The device.** The quantum VM of §4, as a device runtime the way a GPU
runtime is: host code at native speed, only device tiers pay for
reversibility.

**The compiler is optimal within what it claims.** Optimality is defined
against a target description and a declared search space. Optimal
reversible pebbling is PSPACE-complete, so: small kernels are exactly
synthesised, and *minimality* is claimed only with a checkable lower-bound
or exhaustive-search certificate (an exact-synthesis witness alone shows
attainability); large programs carry closed-form cost bounds and a
certificate of the gap between the schedule found and the best bound
known. The compiler chooses adders, pebbling, measurement-based versus
unitary uncomputation, QROM versus QRAM, under a space budget.

**The ecosystem.** A registry of reversible libraries with certificates:
libc, libm, zlib, crypto, SQLite, published as linkable ISA objects so
nobody compiles them twice. Arithmetic is library code too (§6).

### 5.1 Correctness

Ancilla-zero is not correctness: every historical S0 defect in this
project passed a reversibility check. Correctness is defined in three
parts, and every certificate labels each claim as **proof** (exhaustive
over a declared finite domain, or compositional/structural) or
**evidence** (sampled, with seeds and counts), never blurring the two.

1. **Permutation tier, by theorem.** Define the permutation tier *after
   decomposition into the gates actually emitted*: a circuit over
   {X, CX, CCX, exact MCX} is a permutation matrix. Relative-phase Toffoli
   decompositions and measurement-based fixups are **not** in this tier.
   A permutation is determined by its action on basis states. Therefore,
   for a region whose declared interface specifies an expected
   permutation P, over a declared finite domain D: if on every element
   of D the artefact's **entire final register tuple** equals P applied
   to that element, then its restriction to D is exactly P, with no
   relative phase and no residual entanglement. For a lifted oracle, D is
   every input x, every output-target value t, every fault-register value
   e, every value of every borrowed dirty ancilla d, clean ancillae in
   their declared state, and P is |x⟩|t⟩|e⟩|d⟩|0⟩ ↦ |x⟩|t ⊕
   payload(F_B(x))⟩|e ⊕ code(F_B(x))⟩|d⟩|0⟩, where F_B is the bounded
   reference result of §4.2 (native execution supplies f(x); the embedding
   specification supplies the rest). For an in-place bijection, P is
   |x⟩|0⟩ ↦ |g(x)⟩|0⟩ on the mutable wires with workspace clean, and the
   same check establishes g∘ginv = id. Input preservation is a
   hypothesis of the theorem and an acceptance check, not a consequence:
   an artefact that flipped an input bit after an otherwise correct oracle
   would pass every output-only check. **Exhaustive agreement on D is
   complete for D. Sampled differential testing above exhaustive widths is
   evidence, labelled as such.** Clean release and dirty restoration are
   checked by this simulation, not statically.
2. **Non-permutation lowerings, by channel comparison.** Measurement-based
   uncomputation is a channel (an instrument where outcomes are exposed),
   not a unitary on the data; rotations and synthesised gates are unitaries
   with an approximation budget ε. Every such lowering is verified against
   its reference by **process comparison at exhaustive small widths**: the
   induced channel (Choi-state comparison, including a reference system to
   catch lost correlations) for measurement-assisted implementations, and
   unitary equivalence plus **controlled-interference tests** (the artefact
   run controlled and inside an interferometer) for unitaries, with ε and
   its **composition rule** stated per artefact: the metric is the diamond
   norm for channels and a phase-sensitive operator-norm bound for
   unitaries under control, budgets add along a sequence, and the
   certificate carries the sum. Floating-point matrix agreement counts as
   proof only with a rigorous numerical error bound; otherwise it is
   evidence. This is proof for the widths tested and evidence above them.
3. **Algorithms, compositionally.** Grover, amplitude estimation and
   friends are verified by state-vector simulation at small instance size
   with the compiled oracle applied by branch enumeration over its
   permutation segments (§4.2), and resource estimates are produced from
   the oracle's certificate without materialising gates.

**Equivalence is "equals native, or is flagged".** On every element of a
rung's declared domain the artefact must return either the native result
or a fault code; the fault rate over the domain is reported and must be
zero on the rung's acceptance instances; inputs the instrumented
classifiers of §3.2 report as *undefined*, and executions the reference
interpreter classifies as *layout-dependent*, are excluded from native
comparison, validated against the reference interpreter, and counted
separately, with each rung reporting and bounding both excluded
fractions. One outcome table governs §3.2, §5.1 and §8: native-
comparable success, reference fault, layout-dependent reference
validation, classifier-flagged undefined. Domain D stays finite and tractable when large dirty pools
are borrowed by a structural lemma: borrowed wires are used only inside
verified compute–use–uncompute frames, so their restoration is proved per
frame; where that lemma does not apply, dirty restoration above small
widths is labelled evidence.

**What a certificate asserts:** the ISA object, the target, the objective,
the claimed resource vector, the tier and budget of each region, the
definedness assumption, the verification performed (parts 1–3, with
domains, widths, seeds and counts, each labelled proof or evidence), the
fault rate per declared domain, and for small kernels an exact-synthesis
witness and, where minimality is claimed, its lower-bound certificate. A
checker in `bennett-conformance` validates a certificate against the
object without trusting the compiler; replayable validation records are
not proofs and are labelled evidence.

## 6. The right language for each job

| Component | Language | Why (taste excluded) |
|---|---|---|
| Pass plugin (taint, outlining, body generation, lowering to the ISA) | **C++** | The only component of the compiler core that links LLVM (Bennett.jl, as a front end, uses LLVM.jl). `llvmGetPassPluginInfo` has C linkage, but registering a new-PM pass and every analysis the plugin needs (loop info, dominators, scalar evolution for bound refinement, alias analysis, MemorySSA, `CodeExtractor`) are C++ API only. v1 is the evidence of avoiding this: it reimplements loop analysis in `src/lowering/cfg.jl` and parses MemorySSA out of printed text in `src/memssa.jl`. Enzyme is C++ for the same reason. Built per LLVM major. Kept narrow: it does not contain the scheduler. |
| Scheduler and cost model (`bennett-sched`) | **Rust**, C ABI owned by the ISA spec | Linked by the plugin (compile time) and the VM (run time); it is what makes decision 6 literally true. No LLVM dependency. |
| ISA spec tooling, VM / device runtime, circuit specialiser, estimator | **Rust** | None touch LLVM: they consume the ISA's serialised form. Embeddable device library with no runtime; memory safety in a component that must never crash a host; usable without std near kernels; a JIT tier available without LLVM. Rust ownership is affine, not linear, so it models qubit ownership well with a leak check, not natively. |
| Driver | **Rust**, invoking LLVM tools (`opt`, `lld`) as external processes and the plugin through them | The driver orchestrates bitcode but does not link LLVM itself; that keeps the "C++ only where LLVM is linked" rule true. |
| **The Julia quantum language**, REPL, research laboratory | **Julia (Bennett.jl)** | Bennett is the family name: Bennett.jl *is* the Julia quantum language (`when`, oracles, in-place regions, certificates, `@cost`), the first front end built on the dialect, and the product's face. The former Sturm.jl is sunset; its surface constructs and its MCX kernel are absorbed here. Bennett.jl orchestrates the driver in-process through LLVM.jl while the LLVM tools themselves run out of process; new lowerings and arithmetic are prototyped here against the spec. |
| Arithmetic and runtime libraries (adders, multipliers, QROM, soft-float, allocator shims, libc, device models) | **Any** | Ordinary code compiled through the same pipeline and shipped as ISA objects with certificates. "Runtimes are libraries" applies to arithmetic too; the specialiser links them. |

Consequence: the centre of gravity leaves Julia. Bennett.jl is the front
door of Bennett, not the whole of it. The maintainer has stated this is
acceptable; the north star outranks language preference.

### 6.1 Many small repositories, two contracts, fully enumerated

**A monolith will grind to a halt** (maintainer, 2026-10-28). Independent
repositories, each developable, versioned, tested, and released on its
own, communicating only through **two published contracts**:

- **`bennett-dialect-spec`**: the marker-function ABI (names, signatures,
  the positive legality requirement), the portable handle convention, the
  outlining, budget and region well-formedness conventions, the legality
  conformance corpus, the driver's plugin-invocation interface,
  versioning.
- **`bennett-isa-spec`**: everything in §4.4: instruction set and formal
  model, resource vector and target-description format with capabilities,
  object and link format with the reversible ABI, host–device launch ABI
  (including how host code that interleaves genuine host effects with
  handle or measurement manipulation is split from the device's
  classical-control tier), scheduling interface, certificate schema,
  coverage-report format, serialisation, conformance suite. Its sub-
  artefacts (ISA, object format, launch ABI, certificate schema) are
  versioned independently.

Nothing shares code across a contract boundary; anything that needs to is
a sign the boundary is wrong. **One semantics comes from the ISA spec's
formal model and conformance suite, never from shared code.** The dialect
spec additionally carries a **reference semantics** from marker programs
to the ISA formal model (including the copy, store and in-place rules of
§4.2), so a competing plugin is conformance-tested at spec level and not
only by native differential. **Binary edges are versioned too:** a
`bennett-sched` built against ISA spec vN is replaceable without
rebuilding the plugin, and a plugin is replaceable without rebuilding the
driver; the substitutability test covers binary edges as well as document
edges.

| Repository | Owns | Depends on |
|---|---|---|
| `bennett-dialect-spec` | as above, plus the normalisation rules and residual-poison validator | ISA spec (its reference semantics targets the ISA formal model) |
| `bennett-isa-spec` | as above | nothing |
| `bennett-sched` | scheduler and cost model behind the ISA spec's scheduling interface | ISA spec |
| `bennett-plugin` | the C++ LLVM pass plugin; built per LLVM major | dialect spec, ISA spec, sched (binary) |
| `bennett-driver` | link-time driver: bitcode merge, plugin invocation, fat objects, launch, coverage reports; per-front-end integration | dialect spec, ISA spec, plugin (binary) |
| `bennett-vm` | the Rust device runtime: classical-control tier, history layers, effect tape, device models, branch-enumeration simulation, launch-time lowering to the target alphabet, JIT tier | ISA spec, sched |
| `bennett-circuits` | the bounded specialiser: hierarchical circuit IR, placement, proof-carrying output, exporters (OpenQASM 3, QIR, Quil) | ISA spec, sched |
| `bennett-estimate` | resource estimation from ISA objects, certificates and target descriptions, no gates materialised | ISA spec |
| `bennett-targets` | target descriptions per hardware model, contributed by vendors; importers for existing resource-model formats | ISA spec |
| `bennett-runtimes` | allocator, libc/musl shims, device models, Julia shim runtime, bitcode builds of language runtimes, as ordinary code compiled to ISA objects | dialect spec; driver (build tool) |
| `bennett-arith` | adders, multipliers, QROM, soft-float, as ISA library objects with certificates | dialect spec; driver (build tool) |
| `Bennett.jl` | the Julia quantum language: `when`, oracles, in-place regions, certificate kinds, simulators as VM targets, REPL, `@cost`, research lab | driver (binary), ISA spec |
| `bennett-conformance` | the demo ladder as executable gates, the certificate checker, the legality corpus runner, the differential harness with the instrumented classifiers of §3.2 | everything, as a consumer only |

The test of the split: every repository can be replaced by a competitor's
implementation of the same spec without the rest noticing.

## 7. Landscape: what is taken, what is rejected, what is new

| System | What Bennett takes | What it does differently |
|---|---|---|
| **Enzyme** | The delivery model: an LLVM plugin, marker calls, optimise–transform–optimise, LTO for cross-TU bodies, per-LLVM-major builds; activity analysis as the precedent for taint analysis. | Reversibilisation instead of differentiation; the output is a program for a second executor, not more LLVM IR. |
| **PTX / CUDA, OpenMP offload** | Virtual ISA with per-hardware target descriptions; host/device split; fat objects; a launch runtime. | We own the driver and launch runtime; nothing is reused from clang's offload machinery. |
| **Quil / QAM, eQASM, Knill's QRAM model** | The idea of a public abstract machine with a classical controller; Quil as an import/export format. | Those machines execute hand-built circuits with classical control; none has virtual allocation classes, garbage as a resource, bounded coherent control over arbitrary programs, linking, or a resource vector. |
| **QIR** (QIR Alliance) | LLVM as the carrier; profiles as a warning. Its adaptive profile and memory-management spec exist and are read on import. | Stated precisely: qubits are opaque pointers with no ownership discipline (they do participate in SSA dataflow); adjoint and controlled bodies are emitted by the front end as separate functions, so the IR carries no structural algebra over them; no uncomputation, garbage, resource model, or oracle abstraction; the profiles mix "program the host runs" with "circuit the device executes". Bennett keeps control and adjoint structural, keeps ownership explicit in the ISA, and puts resources in the spec. |
| **OpenQASM 3** | `ctrl@` / `inv@` modifiers and its dynamic classical control as the export target's expectations. | OpenQASM 3's dynamic control is classical control (§4.2); it is a circuit language, not a program model with memory, linking, or resources. Export only. |
| **CUDA-Q / Quake** | Quantum kernels as device code; `cudaq::control` / `cudaq::adjoint` at function granularity; the ref-vs-wire distinction, adopted as dialect-vs-ISA. | Not a new language or kernel annotation: taint is inferred over unmodified C, Rust, Julia. The carrier is LLVM bitcode, because that is what every front end emits; MLIR lowering paths are an import door. |
| **Catalyst, MLIR quantum dialects, Qrisp** | Import path for programs already in those dialects; precedent for a JIT tier; Qrisp's automatic uncomputation over Python-level programs. | Arbitrary LLVM programs, not a Python-hosted language. |
| **Q#** | Adj+Ctl specialisation from one body. | Specialisation in the plugin over any language's IR, not in one language's compiler. |
| **Quipper** | Oracle synthesis from classical code; `with_computed`. | Any LLVM language; a VM and ISA beneath. |
| **Silq, Unqomp, Reqomp, SQUARE** | Automatic and budgeted uncomputation; garbage as a resource with a budget; **the uncomputation-validity condition of §4.2 is Silq's `qfree`/`const` discipline and Unqomp's criterion, adopted as an ISA invariant.** | Uncomputation scheduled at run time by the VM as well as at compile time, under a target's resource vector, inside that invariant. |
| **Quantum Control Machine (Yuan, Villanyi, Carbin 2023)** | The injectivity and synchronisation analysis of quantum control flow, which the step machine of §4.2 must satisfy. | Bennett's embedding preserves classical inputs through the oracle interface and cleans control state at region exit, rather than lifting unrestricted quantum control flow. |
| **QCOR / XACC, Qiskit classical-function compiler, tweedledum / RevKit, ProjectQ Compute/Uncompute, REVS (Parent–Roetteler–Svore)** | C++ quantum kernels through a clang plugin with compute/action/uncompute and automatic ctrl/adjoint; oracle synthesis from classical functions; the compute/uncompute idiom. | Whole programs in any LLVM language rather than annotated kernels or small classical-function languages; a VM and ISA beneath. |
| **Tower, Spire** | Superposed pointers and classically bounded recursion as the right semantics for coherent data structures; Spire's accounting of the cost of padded coherent control. | The same semantics, for programs nobody rewrote; the step machine of §4.2 is the general case. |
| **Qualtran, Azure RE** | Symbolic, hierarchical resource counting without materialised gates; target models as data. | Certificates attached to linkable objects; the target-description format accepts imported models, converting units where they align with the target's declared resources and otherwise importing them as new named resources. |
| **QSSA, QIRO, HUGR / Guppy / tket2** | Linear SSA for quantum values; HUGR's hierarchical hybrid graph and Guppy's Python-embedded typed quantum language as the closest contemporary program-level IR. | Used in the ISA, not imposed on LLVM IR; HUGR is an import/export door. |
| **ReVerC** | Verified reversible compilation of a small language. | Correctness by theorem plus oracle (§5.1) for arbitrary LLVM input. |
| **Reversible pebbling (Bennett 89, Knill 95, PRS15, Chan et al.)** | The space-time trade-off theory and its hardness result. | Pebbling as run-time policy over a resource vector, not only a compile-time choice. |

**What is new**, claimed narrowly: (a) inferred-taint reversibilisation of
unmodified programs in any LLVM language, delivered as a link-time plugin,
with total coherent regions and a fault outcome; (b) a public virtual ISA
for quantum programs with virtual qubits, allocation classes, bounded
coherent control of arbitrary CFGs, garbage as a scheduled resource, a
resource vector, linking, and a host–device ABI; (c) one scheduler used at
compile time and run time behind a published interface; (d) correctness
defined by the permutation theorem plus channel-comparison oracles,
attached to linkable objects as certificates that separate proof from
evidence. Everything else is adopted from the systems above with
attribution.

## 8. Demo ladder (success criteria, each with its acceptance test)

| Rung | Demo | Acceptance test |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Scalar C, Rust, Julia functions | Exhaustive at Int8 over the full domain D of §5.1 part 1, both executors equal to native; fault rate zero. |
| 2 | Pointers, structs, byte memory | A C hashtable (the existing 258-line corpus): forward result equal to native on every tested input (independent check), then reversed byte-exactly, both executors. |
| 3 | musl hello-world | Forward output equal to native; run in the reversible tier with a console device model; un-run to the reset state; tape replay deterministic. |
| 4 | **Grover over SQLite** | SQLite compiled unmodified to the coherent tier under a region budget, with an in-memory VFS over quantum-addressed memory. Database of N rows fixed classically before entry; the predicate is a real SQL query parameterised by a `rowid` bound from the superposed register; the oracle bit is the query's match for that row. (a) Oracle verified by §5.1 part 1 over all rows and all target values for N ≤ 2¹⁰, fault rate zero. (b) End-to-end Grover by state-vector simulation with branch enumeration at N ≤ 2⁸. (c) A resource estimate for N = 2²⁰ under a named target, reporting the budget and the padded cost. Nobody rewrote SQLite. |
| 5 | Julia on a shim runtime | `push!` and `Dict` work because the allocator works, with zero compiler awareness of either; forward results equal to native Julia; reversal exact. |
| 6 | xv6, then Linux `tinyconfig` | Serial console output equal to a native (QEMU) run of the same image (independent forward check); boots in the reversible tier with device models; un-boots to the reset vector; tape replay byte-identical. |
| 7 | **Quantum fuzzing of the kernel** | Kernel state snapshot fixed classically after boot; a step budget; syscall arguments as the superposed input over a declared small space; devices virtualised; the oracle bit is the panic flag. The contract is the optimised-IR reference semantics of §3.2 under a recorded definedness assumption; the kernel's own source UB is not detected after optimisation and is not claimed to be. (a) Oracle verified by §5.1 part 1 against native execution of the same snapshot per basis input, with classifier-flagged inputs reported, fault rate zero on the declared space. (b) Amplitude amplification by state-vector simulation at a toy argument space. (c) A resource estimate under a named target. The oracle is Linux. |
| 8 | **Amplitude estimation on a Monte Carlo in plain C** | Written by someone who has never heard of a Toffoli gate. The entropy device is replaced by a superposed register; everything else is fixed classically before entry. (a) Oracle by §5.1 part 1; (b) estimation by simulation at small precision; (c) resource estimate. |

Rungs 1–3 and 5–6 are the blueprint's; 4, 7, 8 define success for the
vision; nobody promises 6–8 on a schedule.

## 9. Open technical questions (deferred by the maintainer's rule: vision first)

In the order the next iteration should take them. Items the council
promoted from "detail" to "load-bearing" are now answered at vision level
above and appear here only for their mechanics.

1. **The legality spike** (§3.2): the marker corpus against every stock
   pass at O3 and through native codegen; emission examples from clang,
   rustc and Julia; gate on freezing the dialect spec.
2. **Handle → wire conversion**: the verifier, what it rejects (including
   the uncomputation-validity invariant and the copy/store/in-place rules
   of §4.2), the leak check.
3. **Compilation model mechanics** (§3.3): LTO extension point vs `opt`;
   fat-object layout; the launch ABI; host-triple intrinsic and asm
   classification tables; bitcode builds of language runtimes.
4. **Budget mechanics**: out-of-band budget tables; scalar-evolution
   refinement; how the specialiser recovers structure from the step
   machine; the exact fault-code set.
5. **Effect virtualisation**: which device models exist (VFS, console,
   clock, entropy, block device, network as a recorded peer), how they are
   expressed as reversible state, what is refused.
6. **Measurement-based uncomputation under control**: the v1
   `PermClean`-style certificate (inherited from the sunset Sturm.jl)
   cannot express it; the certificate kind with classical fixup and its
   controlled form, fixed in Bennett.jl's language before any gate record
   freezes.
7. **Reversible ABI and linking**: call/uncall convention, shared ancilla
   frames, structural symbol resolution, content-addressed objects.
8. **Run-time scheduling policy**: history layers, checkpoint interval,
   delta quality, recomputation of coherent regions, as resource policy
   under the vector of §4.3.
9. **ISA serialisation and versioning**; conformance suite; the formal
   model's scope.
10. **Per-LLVM-major builds**; Julia in-process invocation through LLVM.jl.
11. Concurrency (sequentialised with a recorded schedule; the single-
    thread assumption of §3.2 is the v1 contract), self-modifying code,
    signals, setjmp. Floating point is decided in §3.2 (deterministic
    soft-float in both builds) and is no longer open.
12. Repository hosting and release mechanics for §6.1.

## 10. Process

Vision first (this document), iterate with the council, then design, then
spikes, then code. The current Bennett.jl and BennettVM.jl are frozen as
the v1 reference and differential oracle. No reboot code is written on the
strength of this document. Worklog, beads, red-green, exhaustive
verification, no remote CI carry over unchanged.


# The document under review (round 1 snapshot)

# Dossier: bennett-4ht re-check of four accepted contract proposals (z4c, adg, checker-diagnostics, 5u3)

Scope of this re-check (advisor ruling R6(b), 2026-11-02): each proposal below was accepted by both council members (sol, astra) in its round 1 (runs bennett/docs/council/contract-<id>-2026-11-02/round-1, consensus agree, empty blocking lists). Those rounds were prepared before the rubric's standing check "the mixed fat object stays reachable" (bead bennett-4ht, rubric commit 84a6fcf) existed. This round re-checks the four proposals against that check ONLY; their contract content is accepted and not under review. The proposals are reproduced verbatim from each run's round-1/doc.md, separated by horizontal rules. z4c, adg and checker-diagnostics amend Bennett ISA 0.9; 5u3 amends the Bennett dialect spec.

---

## Dossier part: z4c (run contract-z4c-2026-11-02, round 1 accepted)

# z4c — addresses for action-local region support

Proposal for council review; not a spec edit or an implementation claim.
Bead: `b-isa-spec-z4c`; blocks reference slice `b-isa-spec-fuk.3`.

## Defect and scope

ISA 0.9 §4.6, `qregion`, requires unconditional function-entry allocation
and image preparation, function scope, and function-exit restoration and
release. §16.2 permits a declaration inside either qif arm and inside a
qloop, including a zero-trip loop. §11 Matching requires every generated
leaf to end at a point whose iteration vector has the point's lexical loop
depth. K64 supplies non-row addresses only in a containing **oracle**.
K65 explicitly excludes implicit region restoration from cleanup carriers.

Consequently the following admitted action has mandatory leaves without
legal terminal addresses:

```text
action @gap (t:wire mut) () () () ()
regs {  } bounds {0}
^entry():
qloop 0 {
qregion local 0 1
}
x t
```

The associated signature has `mut:[1]`, `bounds:[0]`. The declaration is
`entry:1`; there is no executed iteration. `iteration:[]` has the wrong
depth and `[0]` is outside a zero-trip loop. Wildcard selectors can match
existing coordinates but cannot create a coordinate. Omitting the leaves
violates §4.6 even for an entirely default schedule. Calling them oracle
support contradicts K64's validation domain.

This is an S0 contract defect under rubric C5/C8: implementers must invent
an address or reject valid source. North Star §4.2 requires structured
coherent regions with unconditional workspace support; §4.4 requires an
independently implementable scheduler contract. Forbidding nested region
declarations would narrow the existing ISA. The fix preserves every
program, including the full SQLite/demo scope; no placement restriction is
proposed.

## Alternatives and worked witness

| Rule | Result on the witness |
|---|---|
| Action-root support pseudo-points (recommended) | Allocate local once at `$construct/[]/0`; execute X once at `entry:2/[]/0`; release local once at `$release/[]/0`. |
| Give declarations a separate hoisted coordinate type | Sound if it explicitly separates declaration coordinates from body iterations; requires another selector encoding and validation rule. |
| Use the lexical point with an invented iteration | `[]` violates depth; `[0]` names a nonexistent iteration. Requires a different normative rule, not an implementation convention. |
| Omit support or reject this source | Violates §4.6; rejected. |

Hand execution: for t=0, forward produces t=1; for t=1, t=0. The local
wire is allocated at zero and released at zero in either case. The inverse
restores t exactly and also allocates/releases the local wire once. The
loop body executes zero times. Resource counts before native decomposition
are one allocation, one X, one release. This is a derivation from the
clauses, not a newly run interpreter test. The bead reports a reference
test and diagnostics; those runs were not repeated in this job.

## Recommended exact spec diff

Insert after §11 **Non-row addresses (K64)**, before Whole-cleanup selection:

```diff
+**Action-local region support (K-new).** For each action or perm_action
+invocation, collect all function-local qregion declarations, including
+declarations nested in zero-trip qloops and in either qif arm. Each
+declaration creates one region per invocation, not one per loop visit.
+Traverse declarations in canonical function text order, recursively
+visiting the then arm before the else arm and a loop body once, for
+function-entry allocation and image preparation. Their terminal point is
+$construct in that action. Function-exit image restoration and release
+traverse the declarations in reverse order and have terminal point
+$release. Within a declaration, use the bound library's region creation
+expansion; restoration/release is its exact inverse. These support leaves
+are unconditional as specified in §3.5 and §4.6.
+Number leaves contiguously from zero within each of these pseudo-points
+in forward instantiated support order, including allocation, image gates
+and release leaves, excluding the action body and semantic callee
+subtrees. Each leaf retains its allocation identity. Their own instance
+and source-qloop iteration vectors are []; outer invocation edges retain
+their actual coordinates. At that action level the support has no step
+or phase and matches only wildcard step and phase, under §11 Matching.
+A selector ending at an enclosing oracle level retains that level's
+existing step/phase interpretation.
+Raw inversion of an already expanded trace retains forward pseudo-points,
+ordinals, invocation edges and allocation identities while adjointing
+operations. Source-adjoint formation continues to follow K62.
+Path validation admits $construct and $release for action and perm_action
+support. $step and $commit remain oracle-only. A reserved point with no
+leaves has an empty generated domain. K64's oracle partition and K65's
+exclusion of implicit region cleanup are unchanged.
```

Add to §0.2, assigning the next free K number at application time:

```text
K-new | §4.6, §11, §15 | ACTION-REGION-SUPPORT: action-local qregion
construction/release have reserved root support addresses, including
zero-trip declarations; no leaf changes. | b-isa-spec-z4c | S | –
```

The traversal rule resolves several declarations and both arms without
mistaking source-loop visits for declarations. It adds addresses, not
cleanup realisations or source instructions.

## Hashes, catalog and consumers

No change to canonical object text, semantic envelopes, `ref-0.9.json`, its
hash or generated leaf order is intended. Unaffected object closure hashes
stay fixed; the bead's witness closure hash is reported evidence, not
recomputed here. Address-bearing schedules/certificates for affected
actions must use the new coordinates, so their own serialized hashes
change. Published 0.8 behavior is untouched. Reference, VM, scheduler and
checker must implement identical action support partitioning; clause
extraction/coverage must include the new paragraphs. A catalog change is
unnecessary if its existing region construction already meets §4.6.

## Conformance vectors and verification

After acceptance, add these vectors to suite F and schedule suite H:

1. The zero-trip witness above: both t basis values, forward/inverse;
   exactly the three leaves and coordinates given above; no loop-body leaf.
2. Two declarations, one inside each qif arm: both constructed once in
   then/else text order regardless of selector value, released in reverse
   order. Nested zero-trip loops add no iteration coordinate to support.
3. `qregion r 0 8 @image` with one-byte image `01`: construction emits its
   allocation then X on bit 0; release undoes image then allocation. Check
   contiguous per-point ordinals and raw inverse identity retention.
4. A caller loop invokes this action twice: callee support has `[]`, caller
   edge has `[0]` or `[1]`; no alias of allocation identities across calls.
5. Concrete action `$step`/`$commit` reject; action support with nonempty
   own iteration/instance does not match; duplicate maximal matching
   entries on an actual support leaf reject by K55. Empty support domains
   cannot witness a tie.

These are proposed vectors, not claims of a passing implementation.
The exact commands used for the derivation were `sed -n '954,1617p'
spec/Bennett-ISA-Spec-0.9.md` and `sed -n '2401,2842p'
spec/Bennett-ISA-Spec-0.9.md`, plus inspection of the supplied bead.

## Release and after acceptance

Recommend a **0.9 K-entry repair**, ahead of the blocked reference slice.
Waiting for 0.10 would leave an existing legal 0.9 source without an
address. Council assigns the K number, applies the text, publishes the
vectors, regenerates the 0.8-to-0.9 diff and clause indexes, and authorizes
the reference owner to finish slice .3. The bead stays open until that
contract/implementation acceptance work is complete.

## Dossier part: adg (run contract-adg-2026-11-02, round 1 accepted)

# adg — loaded-program memory lifetime across launches

Proposal for council review; `b-isa-spec-adg`.

## Defect and North Star scope

ISA 0.9 §7.1 defines initial memory, allocation table and bump pointer
without saying whether initialization occurs at load or every run.
§3.2 places the register ledger at program scope; §10 gives a run
exclusive ownership only until CLOSED; §7.4 and T4 restore a run's entry
state on eligible reversal. These strongly favor program-lifetime state
but do not explicitly settle classical memory initialization.

Dialect 0.3 draft §§6.5–6.6 uses a persistent qreg table in device memory
and requires parameter/result roots to survive entry calls. North Star
§3.1's register handles and §5's REPL/library device model require
cross-entry quantum state. A fresh-every-run interpretation loses the
table while live registers remain. This is a contract ambiguity with
observable results, S0 under C1/C5; persistence is the compatible reading.
It adds no restriction to the North Star, including repeated SQLite or
kernel invocations.

## Alternatives and hand-worked witness

Layout: ptr_width=16, H=16, A_tab=2, S_cells=0, null_size=1,
heap_base=16, heap_limit_max=16; a one-byte global g at base 1 with image
00. Run A allocates one byte (returns 16) and stores 7 into g, then
completes and is CLOSED without reversal. Run B loads g and allocates
one byte. Under persistence it returns `(7,17)`; under reinitialization
it returns `(0,16)`. These are distinct visible results from the same
loaded program. Freeing 16 does not reclaim storage under §7.1.

If A is instead successfully REVERSED before CLOSED, its allocation
and store are undone, and B returns `(0,16)`. Merely closing A does not
reverse it. An eligible failed run retains its executed prefix until it
is reversed; closing a failed run does not silently roll it back.

| Alternative | Assessment |
|---|---|
| Program-lifetime memory and ledger (recommended) | Matches §10 ownership and the dialect's persistent table. |
| Reinitialize on each run | Would need a different host-held table and an explicit reset/lifetime ABI; it changes existing consumer assumptions. |
| Implicit reset when no register is live | Still changes classical allocation/global results; no clause authorizes it. |

## Recommended exact spec diff

Insert after §7.1's Initial state sentence:

```diff
+That state is established once when the program is loaded. Classical
+memory, allocation-table entries and the bump pointer belong to the
+loaded program and persist across runs. For sequential launches, a new
+run starts from the state left by the preceding CLOSED run. Closing a run does not restore its
+entry state. If the preceding run was successfully REVERSED before
+being CLOSED, its reversible state is its restored entry state (§7.4,
+§10, T4). A FAILED run otherwise leaves its executed prefix in place.
+Register-ledger entries and live register identities likewise persist
+under §3.3; ownership ends at CLOSED, not the register lifetime. Unloading
+and loading a program creates a new program instance with initial state;
+register ids of the old instance are not imported into it.
```

Append to §10's ownership paragraph:

```diff
+Persistence does not relax exclusive ownership of touched registers or
+memory while a run is not CLOSED. Separate loaded program instances have
+separate state; initialization is never repeated merely to start a run.
```

All examples here use sequential CLOSED runs. This wording does not add a
blanket prohibition on disjoint concurrent runs or invent a memory merge
rule. The existing ownership restrictions still govern overlapping uses.

## Hashes, catalog and consumers

This pins an existing reading: no source, envelope, target or catalog byte
changes and no hash re-pin. A consumer that reset memory on each run must
change its load/run lifecycle; plugin qreg-table code should not change.
Launch bindings and certificates that replay a later entry must include
its actual entry-state/preparation assumptions rather than presume a
fresh load. Domain claims do not acquire coverage of all histories merely
by showing one initialized run. Header diagnostics already include
E_INVALID_STATE; no new numeric status is proposed.

## Conformance vectors and verification

Test load→A→CLOSED→B and load→A→REVERSED→CLOSED→B with the results
above; check every byte, table live bit, bump pointer, register identity
and token lifetime. Add a failed A whose prefix stored 7: B sees 7 unless
that prefix was reversed. If B passes a register still owned by A before
A is CLOSED, it must return E_INVALID_STATE before effects. Fresh loading
restores g=0 and bump=16. A stored id can be recovered by qreg.from_id in
the next run after ownership is released. These are hand derivations;
the scalar state transitions are checked by
[contract-verification](2026-11-02-contract-verification.md), not by a
new reference execution.

## Release and after acceptance

Recommend a **0.9 K wording repair** to §§7.1/10 with lifecycle vectors.
Council should explicitly accept program scope under existing ownership, then
VM/reference owners validate their lifecycle and the dialect updates its
cross-reference. Keep adg open until the contract decision lands.

## Dossier part: checker-diagnostics (run contract-checker-diagnostics-2026-11-02, round 1 accepted)

# Checker question 2 — diagnostic-code ownership

Disposition proposal for council review; source request 2 in
`../bennett-conformance/checker/.tmp/CROSS_REPO_BEADS.md`.

## Defect classification and North Star scope

ISA §12 requires rejection of invalid certificates but defines no global
checker error-code registry. §11 separately mandates
`E_SCHEDULE_INFEASIBLE` and K55's multiple-maximal-entry diagnostic.
Launch §10 enumerates executor statuses; §5.4 enumerates program fault
outcomes. These are different interfaces, and the latter two lists do
not imply an unlisted E_CERT registry.

Two checkers rejecting the same invalid certificate under different
documented local codes compute the same specified verdict. The lack of
a registry is therefore **not an established contract defect**. It is a
possible diagnostics portability improvement (rubric C8/S1). North Star
§§4.4/5.1 requires independent checkability and honest labels, not a
particular spelling for every checker-local code. No capability is lost
by leaving those codes local. Inventing required codes would make
otherwise conformant checkers fail an unstated condition.

## Alternatives and concrete witness

Certificate A omits a table claim's required `expected`. Certificate B
has a complete table and invocation but repeats a component in its domain.
K13 requires A to reject; §12.2 K71 requires B to reject. Checker 1 may
use `E_CERT_RELATION` and `E_CERT_DOMAIN`; checker 2 may use
`missing_expected` and `duplicate_component`. All four diagnostic
spellings are illustrative local choices, not normative codes.

| Alternative | Assessment |
|---|---|
| Keep codes implementation-defined (recommended) | Preserve existing contracts; test local documented codes and normative verdicts separately. |
| Add a small report-location convention | Useful optional interoperability, without reserving every local code. |
| Publish a full ISA-wide E_CERT registry | New interface/versioning work; no evidence it is required for correctness. |
| Reuse launch statuses or quantum fault codes | Conflates checker rejection with run failure or quantum oracle outcome. |

## Recommended exact spec diff

No semantic change or mandatory rejection registry is required. If the
council wants explicit wording, append to §12.3:

```diff
+Checker diagnostic codes other than codes explicitly mandated elsewhere
+in this specification are implementation-defined. A checker SHOULD
+document its stable code meanings and report the failed normative
+obligation and certificate location with a rejection. Such codes are
+scoped by checker name and version; their spelling does not alter the
+verdict or any executor status/fault code. This convention does not
+replace mandated E_SCHEDULE_INFEASIBLE behavior or K55 diagnostics.
```

The original request's mandatory report schema would be a new API; it
should not be inferred from present text. An application needing that
API can version its checker-report format independently.

## Hashes, catalog and consumers

No source, object, target, catalog, schedule or certificate bytes need
change. Optional checker report fields affect only that report's format
and identity. Consumers must not compare an implementation's code against
an invented normative registry. A normative schedule failure still needs
its mandated code and validation stage.

## Conformance vectors and verification

Use A/B above as negative schema/domain tests; assert rejection and the
normative clause, and separately assert the implementation's documented
local code. For an otherwise valid schedule containing duplicate maximal
matching entries, retain K55's named diagnostic and staged rejection.
Do not turn a checker-local mismatch into a program fault or invalid
source verdict. This is a clause derivation; no checker test was run here.
The common document verification checks this disposition's required
sections and source links.

## Release and after acceptance

**No new K requirement and no 0.10 blocker.** Optional 0.9 editorial
clarification is sufficient. The orchestrator can disposition request 2
as documentation/API guidance; it should not file an ISA semantic bug
solely for missing E_CERT spellings. Existing checker tests may continue
to pin their own stable documented codes.

## Dossier part: 5u3 (run contract-5u3-2026-11-02, round 1 accepted)

# 5u3 — exact pointer fixpoints without verdict-changing caps

Proposal for the dialect council; `b-dialect-spec-5u3`, linked to
`bennett-plugin` bp-fj1. This job writes no dialect or plugin source.

## Defect classification and North Star scope

Both dialect `Bennett-Dialect-Spec.md` (draft 0.2.12) and the 0.3 draft
§5 require every verdict/candidate/dispatch domain to come from the
specified reference analysis. §5.1 caps INT atoms at K=4096, but does not
cap explicit object offsets or PT6–PT8 memory intervals. PT2/PT5 use
finite-width modular pointer arithmetic. Hence an explicit enumeration
is finite but can have 2^61 members. §5.1 already admits residue classes
and `*`; it does not require enumerative storage.

The bead establishes a severe implementation/performance problem, **not
by itself an inconsistent or undefined reference semantics**. A sound
over-approximation may still change a compile-time verdict, which §5
forbids. The proposed thresholds (4096 offsets, 4 outside extent, 32 for
unknown extent; max(64,extent/4) slots) are not justified as exact. They
must not become normative merely because one plugin uses them.

North Star §§0/3.3/6.1 require arbitrary defined bounded programs,
whole-program analysis and substitutable compilers; §8 rung 4 requires
unmodified SQLite. Widening that introduces a false handle-use/escape
rejection narrows those capabilities. Removing SQLite features, changing
its source, suppressing vectorisation or declaring valid pointer patterns
unsupported does not resolve the issue. Keep bp-fj1 open for practical
convergence; do not declare the rung delivered from a coarse fixpoint.

## Plugin evidence actually inspected

`../bennett-plugin-rung4/.tmp/rung4/PROGRESS.md` reports 177381 slots
plateauing by round 7 on the N=16, LLVM-18 closure, with additional atoms
still growing. The tail of `.tmp/rung4/prof/trace-k.log` shows round 39,
177381 slots, growth in SQLite integer/value sets, then
`§5.2 PT8/PT9/PT12 budget exhausted` at a memcpy in
`@sqlite3CreateForeignKey`, exit 1 after 3401.31 seconds. It does **not**
demonstrate a converged exact reference fixpoint or prove that remaining
growth is only a pointer chain. The supplied earlier 800k-slot report is
historical bead evidence, not reproduced here. No full sibling gate was
run, and no plugin implementation was copied.

## Alternatives and worked recurrence

Take width W=64 and an unfiltered inclusion cycle with one provenance X:

```text
S initially contains offset 0
S includes { (o+8) mod 2^64 : o in S }
```

Its exact least solution is `{o: o=0 mod 8, 0<=o<2^64}`. There are
`2^64/gcd(8,2^64)=2^61` offsets, representable by one residue class.
For W=8 the set is exactly 0,8,...,248 (32 offsets), followed by 0.
Starting at 3 instead gives 3,11,...,251; adding a seed at 4 gives two
cosets, not `*`. Extent=16 does not permit dropping offsets ≥16:
PT2 retains original provenance and adds EXT/top for possibly invalid
addresses; it does not turn numerical out-of-range into host escape.

A full-width same-object memory copy from offset o to o+8 can similarly
propagate one stored atom along that relation. An exact periodic memory
summary must retain storage width, intervals and value/root provenance;
merging all fields into one slot may turn a nearby integer field into a
handle-derived value. That would be a different verdict even though it
is conservative for aliasing.

| Alternative | Assessment |
|---|---|
| Unbounded explicit enumeration | Same reference semantics, often impractical. Not required by the existing text. |
| Normative widening with the bead's thresholds | Deterministic only with further rules for ordering/stickiness/joins; can reject previously admitted programs. Not acceptable without a capability-preserving lowering for every newly coarse case. |
| Exact symbolic sets and translation-cycle closure (recommended) | Preserves verdicts and handles this witness compactly. Does not claim every SQLite recurrence has this form. |
| Resource/time cap with an explicit unfinished build | Honest operational outcome, not a completed analysis or a source rejection. Remains implementation work. |

## Recommended exact spec diff

Add a dialect K/clarification adjacent to §5.1's K and §5.2's least
fixpoint, in both maintained maps:

```text
The reference bounds INT atoms as above; it imposes no additional
cardinality bound on pointer-offset sets or memory intervals. Implementers
MAY use exact symbolic sets, shared interval relations and SCC
acceleration instead of enumerating represented offsets or slots.
All reference sets and byte/representation-width distinctions must be
preserved for verdicts, candidate sets and dispatch domains. A coarser
summary is not the reference result merely because it is sound for
aliasing. An unfinished analysis reports an unfinished build with the
rule and exhausted implementation resource, not a source rejection,
completed verdict or run-time fault for a valid input.

In a pure modular-translation inclusion SCC, if every cycle transfer is
an unfiltered fixed displacement at one bit width W and preserves one
base/provenance coordinate, close the generated displacements as a
subgroup of Z/(2^W). For a single self-cycle of stride s, each seed a
denotes the coset a modulo gcd(s,2^W). Union distinct seed cosets. For
multiple vertices, retain vertex-specific path displacements; do not
merge their seed coordinates. Apply the same rule to a memory relation
only when every transfer preserves the complete storage interval and
representation width and all PT6–PT8 read/overlap results are identical
to the represented individual slots. Retain every ROOT and FN alternative
explicitly. Otherwise use the original rules or another exact method.
PT2's pointer-index width and preserved high pointer bits still apply;
this rule does not replace them by unrestricted full-pointer addition.
```

Add to §24:

```text
Analysis representation/acceleration is implementation policy; the
default result is the exact §5 least fixpoint, including existing K=4096
INT abstraction. Time or memory caps do not alter that result. A report
of unfinished analysis keeps the remaining implementation obligation open.
```

This recommends an exact acceleration and explicitly **declines new
verdict-affecting bounds**. If council instead wants a new abstract
domain, it must supply canonical joins, evaluation order independence,
ROOT/partial-access rules and a lowering that preserves all programs
previously in scope; the current bead does not establish those properties.

## Hashes, catalog and consumers

An exact representation clarification changes no materialised program,
ISA object/certificate or catalog bytes. A dialect publication still
gets its required revision/mapping identity. A threshold widening could
change descriptors, dispatch domains, diagnostics and emitted object
hashes, so cannot masquerade as a local plugin optimization. Plugin and
independent dialect checker should compare normalized exact results on
small-width cases, not implementation data-structure counts.

## Conformance vectors and verification

Enumerate all W=8, stride-8 cases above and compare their symbolic cosets;
W=64 is a symbolic cardinality test, never a 2^61-element allocation.
Test stride 0, stride 1, multiple seeds, a cycle with a filter (must not
use the pure-cycle rule), and GEP with I(a)<P(a). Memory vectors include
same-width full copies, overlapping partial copies and adjacent handle/
integer fields; retain PT6's non-handle top and ROOT distinctions. Check
identical verdicts independent of worklist order. Mathematical cosets are
checked by [contract-verification](2026-11-02-contract-verification.md).
The SQLite exact fixpoint and production gate remain unverified here.

## Release and after acceptance

Recommend a **dialect K clarification on the current 0.2/0.3 tracks**,
not an ISA-0.10 dependency. As stated, 5u3 is primarily an implementation
scalability request. After acceptance, add the finite vectors and let the
plugin owner establish exact convergence on both LLVM majors and the
full rung-4 closure. No new source restriction is authorized by this note.
