# ISA-specification rubric — the council's scale

The rubric the council (`docs/council/README.md`) uses to grade
`Bennett-ISA-Spec.md`, the founding draft of the Bennett virtual ISA
specification (the `bennett-isa-spec` contract of `Bennett-NorthStar.md`
§4.4 and §6.1). Eight criteria, each scored 1–5 on an absolute scale, plus
blocking issues, a path to accept, and verdicts. Scores are advisory; the
maintainer decides.

## What is being graded, and the goal

A **specification**, at the level of a first normative draft: the
document a VM author, a circuit-specialiser author, a plugin author, a
scheduler author and a hardware vendor would each implement against,
independently, and be conformance-tested on. The maintainer's stated
goal is **an accepted spec that is likely correct**; implementation is
expected to expose frictions afterwards, and that is acceptable. So the
question is not "is every detail enumerated" but "would two independent
implementers build the same machine, and is that machine sound".

## Blocking, S0 and S1, scope

A **blocking** issue is **S0**: uncorrected, two conformant
implementations built from the text would compute different results;
or the semantics is unsound (irreversible where reversibility is
claimed, unphysical, phase-unsafe, dependent on inspecting superposed
data); or the text contradicts itself; or a normative decision is
missing where one is needed to build at all; **or the document narrows
north-star scope**: it rejects, refuses, faults, declares inert or
omits a capability that `Bennett-NorthStar.md` promises (its thesis,
§3–§5 and every rung of the §8 demo ladder), whatever reason it gives.
A narrowing is blocking even when it is disclosed, labelled deferred,
or given a default; the fix is the mechanism, or, where a contract the
document depends on truly lacks something, an explicit blocker naming
the exact change that contract needs.

**S1** issues are ones where an implementer would have to choose, but
any choice yields a conformant machine, or where the normative
obligation is stated and only its enumeration is incomplete (field-
level completeness of C headers, JSON schemas, numerical procedures,
encodings). S1 items are **suggestions**, not blockers, **unless the
document fails to state a default for them**; the document carries a
section of decisions deferred to implementation, each with a default,
and an S1 item with a stated default is closed **only if the default
keeps the capability**. A deferral may postpone mechanics (an encoding,
a table layout, an optimisation); a default of "reject", "refuse",
"none", "fault" or "no effect" for something the north star promises
is a narrowing, hence S0, not a closed S1.

Every blocking issue is tagged with a **scope**: `core` (machine model,
instruction set, regions, uncomputation validity, memory and effects,
formal model, the example objects) or `contract` (targets, objects and
identity, launch, scheduling, certificate, coverage, grammar).
**Acceptance is staged**: core consensus (every member's `verdict_core`
= accept with no core blocking issue) is the first milestone; the
contracts follow. Members give both verdicts.

## The standard

The PTX ISA document, the JVM specification, the RISC-V unprivileged spec,
the LLVM language reference: a stranger implements from the text alone,
and two strangers get the same machine. Precision within full scope:
the scope is fixed by the north star and is not the document's to
trade; within it, a mechanism defined exactly scores above one defined
loosely, and a document never buys precision by cutting scope (that is
a narrowing, S0 above). Skepticism is required: check the quantum semantics
and the reversible-ABI claims against your own knowledge; when the
document ships example objects with hashes and stated results, they are
normative test vectors and have been executed before this round.

### Scale

- **5:** implementable by strangers with no questions; sound; complete for
  its declared scope; nothing superfluous.
- **4:** implementable with one gap an implementer names at once.
- **3:** a competent draft; the shape is right but several rules need an
  author's clarification before implementation.
- **2:** aspirational; semantics sketched, not pinned.
- **1:** inconsistent or unphysical at the core.

## Criteria

### C1 Machine model
Tiers, state, types, the step relation: unambiguous? Could two
implementers draw the same state diagram?

### C2 Instruction set
Every instruction with form, operands, well-formedness, semantics, cost
hook; closed and sufficient for what the dialect must lower; nothing
underdetermined.

### C3 Coherent semantics
The predicated step machine, the oracle interface F_B, the action
interface, nesting, exit synchronisation, the prefix-reversal invariant,
the fault register, the budget unit, in-place bijections, the
uncomputation-validity invariant, borrow frames: checkable rules, nothing
irreversible, phase-unsafe or dependent on inspecting superposed data.

### C4 Resources and targets
Resource vector, qubit classes, the target-description format, matching
and cost rules: complete enough that a vendor could write one and the
scheduler consume it, with defaults where the spec defers.

### C5 Contracts
Object format, identity, linking, reversible ABI, launch ABI, scheduling
interface, certificate schema, coverage: each **decided** to the level the
north star promises, so the repositories can be developed independently;
S1 enumeration gaps with stated defaults do not lower this score below 4.

### C6 Formal model and conformance
Abstract semantics an implementer can check against; theorems stated
with explicit hypotheses; a conformance suite derivable from the text.
**Formal correctness is pursued after practical revisions** (maintainer
decision, 2026-10-28): proof formats, mechanisation, rigorous numerical
or SDP witness schemas and checker algorithms are S1 in this phase. A
false or unsound statement is S0; a missing proof is not.

### C7 Consistency with the north star and prior art
No contradiction with `Bennett-NorthStar.md`; established forms used
where they exist.

### C8 Implementability and clarity
Could a VM author and a specialiser author each start tomorrow? Are the
deferred items genuinely non-semantic, each with a default?

## What the council returns

Per criterion: a score 1–5, evidence pointing at the text, the single
change that would most raise it. Then `blocking` (id, section, scope,
severity S0, problem, and the concrete rule the spec should state),
`previous_status` (every previous-round blocker: resolved / partially /
unresolved / regressed, with a note), `regressions`, `suggestions`
(S1 and nits), `path_to_accept`, `verdict_core`, `verdict`, `summary`.
Consensus is reached when every member returns `accept` with an empty
blocking list; core consensus when every member returns `verdict_core`
= accept with no core-scoped blocker.

**Shape of a blocking item.** `steps` are optional (a free-text `problem` is also accepted; steps are preferred for
implementation findings with a reproducible witness). When given they are 3 to 6 numbered steps
`{"n": "<1>1", "claim": "...", "by": "..."}`. Step 1 is what the spec requires (`by`
starts with `clause:<ID>`, a clause or section id from the clause graph, or with
`ASSUMED: <why the spec is silent>`); then what the document or implementation does, with a `witness:<path or
command>` that reproduces it; then an input on which the two differ; the last step is the
conclusion, citing earlier steps with `step:<n>`. `OPEN: <what is missing>` marks a step you
cannot justify. If step 1 is `ASSUMED:` the item is a spec gap: set `"kind": "spec-gap"`; it is
reported to the spec owner and is neither an editor blocker nor counted against `accept`.
The `fix` field is unchanged.
